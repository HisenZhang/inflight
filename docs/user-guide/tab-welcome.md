# WELCOME Tab

The WELCOME tab is a static landing page that provides an app overview and legal disclaimer.

## What It Shows

The page displays the app title and tagline, a prominent disclaimer stating "NOT FAA APPROVED — EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY," a list of 5 key capabilities, 4 important limitations, and a quick start guide with 4 steps.

## What You Can Do

There is one button labeled "GET STARTED" that takes you to the DATA tab to load the database. That's the only interaction available on this screen.

## Why It Exists

This page serves as the legal disclaimer and provides quick orientation for first-time users. You can read it once and then move on to the actual planning tools.
