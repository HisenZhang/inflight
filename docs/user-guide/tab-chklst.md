# CHKLST Tab

Interactive checklist for Piper Cherokee 140. Check off items as you complete them.

## What It Is

**10 checklists** for normal operations:

1. Before Start (10 items)
2. Engine Start (10 items)
3. Before Taxi (5 items)
4. Run-up (15 items)
5. Before Takeoff (10 items)
6. Climb (6 items)
7. Cruise (5 items)
8. Descent (10 items)
9. After Landing (7 items)
10. Shutdown (7 items)

**Hard-coded for PA-28-140.** Not customizable.

## How It Works

**Check items:** Tap checkbox → saves state to localStorage.

**Auto-collapse:** Completed sections turn green and collapse. Next section auto-expands.

**Persistent:** Checkbox states survive browser restart.

**Reset:** Click **RESET ALL** → unchecks everything, collapses all except Before Start.

## Disclaimer

**Not FAA approved.** Always use your aircraft's official POH checklist. This is a training tool/reference only.

Verify procedures against your specific aircraft—not all PA-28-140s are configured identically.

## Example Item

```text
☐ Fuel selector - DESIRED TANK
```

After you set fuel selector, tap checkbox. Item stays checked until you reset.

**This is for practice/convenience.** Carry your POH checklist for actual flight operations.
