- PF: Performs each item
- PM: Checks box after verification
- PM: "Before start checklist complete"

### Training Scenarios

**Solo Practice:**
- Work through checklist on ground
- Simulate each action
- Build muscle memory
- Check boxes as you go

**Instructor-Student:**
- Instructor reads checklist
- Student performs actions
- Builds proper habits
- Teaches checklist discipline

## Regulatory Considerations

**Part 91 Operations:**
- Checklists recommended, not required (except for specific checks)
- Good aeronautical practice
- Supports pilot proficiency

**Part 135/121 Operations:**
- Not approved for commercial use
- Use company-approved checklists
- InFlight CHKLST for personal practice only

## Next Steps

- **[Review Entire Checklist](tab-chklst.md#checklist-sections)** - Familiarize before flight
- **[Practice Ground](tab-chklst.md#training-scenarios)** - Run through on ground first
- **[Compare to POH](#piper-cherokee-140-specifics)** - Verify against official procedures

## Summary

The CHKLST tab provides an interactive digital checklist for:
- Structured pre-flight procedures
